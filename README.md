# Banking-Data-Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for credit risk assessment. The solution empowers financial institutions to make data-driven lending decisions, minimizing potential losses by predicting an applicant's probability of loan repayment.

## Problem Statement

The core challenge in banking and financial services is **credit risk**â€”the potential that a borrower will fail to meet their obligations and cause a financial loss. The primary goal is to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics and leverage data to minimize this risk when lending to customers.

## Solution

Our solution is a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** that transforms complex applicant data into actionable insights.

**How it works:**
- The dashboard ingests and analyzes key applicant profile data (e.g., credit history, income, existing debts, employment status).
- Using advanced analytics and built-in logic, it assesses the likelihood of an applicant repaying a loan.
- It provides a clear, visual recommendation: **approve** the loan for low-risk applicants or **reject/flag** it for high-risk applicants.

This data-driven approach moves beyond subjective judgment, enabling the company to build a healthier loan portfolio and reduce financial losses.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Risk Scoring:** Visual indicators and scores showing an applicant's risk level.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Decisions are based on historical data trends and predictive metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive filters and visualizations for loan officers to drill down into specific applicant details.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Helps quickly identify safe investments and potential defaults.

## Technology Stack

- **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI (Latest Version)
- **Data Processing:** Power Query (M Language)
- **Dashboard Logic:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- **Data Sources:** CSV, SQL Database, or other financial data systems.
